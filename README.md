# push_swap_42

Push_swap is a project assigned at 42 School (Ã‰cole 42) aimed at mastering algorithmic problem-solving skills and understanding the principles of sorting algorithms.

The main objective of Push Swap is to efficiently sort a given stack of integers in ascending order using only two stacks and a predefined set of operations. The project emphasizes the development of optimized sorting algorithms and strategies for minimizing the number of operations required to sort the stack.

The goal is to minimize the number of moves required to sort the stack.

### Installing and running the project:
1. Clone the repository:
```C
    git clone git@github.com:lh-lena/42_push_swap.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```C
    cd 42_push_swap
```
3. Compile the project: 
```C
    make
```
4. Run the program: 
```C
    ./push_swap [unsorted list of integers]
```
```C
  ARG="[unsorted list of integers]"; ./push_swap $ARG
```
